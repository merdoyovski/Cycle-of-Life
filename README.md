# The Cycle of Life

Visualization of the cycle of life and the chaos inside the living. Atoms represented by circles are constantly constructing DNAs by forming a sine wave together, spending their lifetime, and finally, vanish only to be replaced by new atoms to complete the cycle of life.

Implemented using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. Currently using [P5.gui](https://github.com/bitcraftlab/p5.gui) for UI.
